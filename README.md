Berkeley Hyperloop Control Repo

This is the overarching repository for all subsystem related code and testing. There are folders for each embedded system along with heavy documentation and an up to date wiki. Keep in mind the good practices of TDD and commenting also try to work primarily on seperate branches and sumbit pull requests when adding to the master branch. Each system should be on its own branch until it has passed all preliminary tests and is ready for hardware testing. There will only be hardware testing once the code has been demonstrated and approved.
